## Introduction
Older adults with mobility disabilities have much to gain from using voice-activated digital assistants (DHAs). Specifically, using a DHA can help older adults socially engage, perform enhanced activities of daily living that can promote well-being, and possibly promote independence and successful aging in place. Although older adults tend to have positive attitudes towards DHAs and existing older adult users engage with their DHA devices for a diverse range of activities, two key barriers to use commonly occur for older adults with mobility disabilities: 

1. need for integrated instructional support
2. lacking awareness of usable/useful applications/skills.

The Help and Recommendation Application attempts to adress these issues.

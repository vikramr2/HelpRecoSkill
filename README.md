## Introduction
Older adults with mobility disabilities have much to gain from using voice-activated digital assistants (DHAs). Specifically, using a DHA can help older adults socially engage, perform enhanced activities of daily living that can promote well-being, and possibly promote independence and successful aging in place. Although older adults tend to have positive attitudes towards DHAs and existing older adult users engage with their DHA devices for a diverse range of activities, two key barriers to use commonly occur for older adults with mobility disabilities: 

1. need for integrated instructional support
2. lacking awareness of usable/useful applications/skills.

The Help and Recommendation Application attempts to adress these issues.

## Installation
1. Create an Amazon Developer Account
2. Visit the [Alexa Skills Development](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-skills-kit) page
3. Go to "Console"
4. Click on "Create Skill"
5. You can then enter the link to this repository to model your skill after this one.

## Usage
This app can be used both on the testing suite in the Alexa Developer Console, as well as on an Alexa device using the same email as the one linked to your Amazon Developer account. Both GUI and voice based commands are recognized.
  
Navigate between step by step instructions as well as through linked videos on how to use different features on the Amazon Alexa. Find instructions and suggestions on how to check the weather, how to set a timer, and much more.
  
The Help and Recommend Application also gives suggestions on other Alexa skills that may be useful. Illustrations and snapshots of the application can be found further down.
